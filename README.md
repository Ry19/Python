# Python
Join me on my journey as I learn Python!

So far in the past month I've graduated from learning about data science in python to actual programming. It's a slog, but lets face it, what in life isn't?. It's gonna take weeks before I get good at programming, but man am I enjoying every second of it! If you do like the effort, please do check out my blog and leave suggestions. I'm always game for feedback!
